## Usage üöÄ

You can access the Django admin panel to view and manage the saved crypto prices:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/crypto_prices/cryptoprice/

## Customization üß©

- The fetching of cryptocurrency prices from the Binance API and saving them to the database is implemented in the `save_crypto_prices` view function in `crypto_prices/views.py`. Customize this function to suit your needs.
- The `CryptoPrice` model in `crypto_prices/models.py` defines the fields for the cryptocurrency prices. Modify the model to include additional fields if desired.
- The `CryptoPriceAdmin` class in `crypto_prices/admin.py` customizes the admin panel display for the `CryptoPrice` model. Modify this class to add more customization if needed.
